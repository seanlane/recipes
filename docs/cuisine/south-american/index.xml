      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the liberty of modifying the recipe slightly, since we don&amp;rsquo;t usually have achiote or balsalmic vinegar. I replaced the former with some paprika and pepper (the Internet said that was okay) and the latter with some red or cider vinegar with sugar.
If you need to cook shredded chicken relatively quickly:
 Heat a pan to medium-high heat. Drizzle about 1-2 teaspoons of olive oil into the pan. Apply salt and pepper to two chicken breasts, then sear on both sides (about 3-5 minutes per side) Add about 1 cup chicken broth, reduce heat, and cover.</description>
