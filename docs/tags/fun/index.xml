      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the liberty of modifying the recipe slightly, since we don&amp;rsquo;t usually have achiote or balsalmic vinegar. I replaced the former with some paprika and pepper (the Internet said that was okay) and the latter with some red or cider vinegar with sugar.
If you need to cook shredded chicken relatively quickly:
 Heat a pan to medium-high heat. Drizzle about 1-2 teaspoons of olive oil into the pan. Apply salt and pepper to two chicken breasts, then sear on both sides (about 3-5 minutes per side) Add about 1 cup chicken broth, reduce heat, and cover.</description>

      <description>Be careful to avoid making the dough too thin in the center, otherwise it won&amp;rsquo;t be strong enough to hold the pieces together while dipping. This would probably be pretty awesome with some Pesto mixed into the toppings as well, but that&amp;rsquo;s future scientific research to perform.

      <title>Easy Crockpot Sriracha Honey Chicken Wings</title>

      <description>Additional Notes:
You can use fresh wings. Cook time would be 3-4 hours on low or 1 to 2 hours on high. Additionally, when using fresh your sauce will cook quicker. Approximately 3-5 minutes.
Instead of cooking the sauce down and broiling it you can mix up 2 tablespoons corn starch and 2 tablespoons water in a resealable container and shake it really well. Pour slurry into crockpot then cook an additional 30 minutes on high.</description>
