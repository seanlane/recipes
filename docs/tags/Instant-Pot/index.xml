      <title>Green Chicken Chili</title>

      <description>I derived this recipe from combining a couple of recipes:
 https://simpleasthatblog.com/instant-pot-green-chicken-chili/ https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/263617/chef-johns-green-chicken-chili/  We didn&amp;rsquo;t have chipotle powder on hand, so I used paprika as a substitute, and skipped the chile powder that was also mentioned to keep the heat down. I&amp;rsquo;d describe it as not spicy for anyone who normally enjoys spicy foods, and mild for those who are sensitive to it. If you want to make it spicy, using spicier green salsas, keeping the jalape√±o seeds, or using more/different peppers can all do that.</description>

      <description>Great one pot meal using the Instant Pot. We tend to do it with Coconut Milk, since that can store in the pantry.</description>
