      <description>Be careful to avoid making the dough too thin in the center, otherwise it won&amp;rsquo;t be strong enough to hold the pieces together while dipping. This would probably be pretty awesome with some Pesto mixed into the toppings as well, but that&amp;rsquo;s future scientific research to perform.
If you need to cook shredded chicken relatively quickly:
 Heat a pan to medium-high heat. Drizzle about 1-2 teaspoons of olive oil into the pan.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve personally found the searing portion of this recipe to not be strictly necessary, and if you like onions then adding a bed of onions to slow cooker with the juices can add some additional flavor. But it&amp;rsquo;s pretty optional as well, and allows for the recipe to be pretty flexible on the prep time.</description>
