      <description>We often skip the tomato and lettuce, and use cheddar cheese, depending what we have on hand.</description>

      <title>Sausage Pasta</title>

      <description>This recipe is primarily based on https://www.rachelcooks.com/2018/03/12/instant-pot-pasta-sausage-spinach/, but with some further inspiration from https://www.budgetbytes.com/italian-wonderpot/.
You can also use Pork Sausage links, or a regular package of sausage as well. Drain extra grease before adding pasta if needed. You can experiment with using sweet or spicy sausage as well, depending on what you like.</description>

      <title>Green Chicken Chili</title>
      <link>https://recipes.lane.sh/recipes/green-chicken-chili/</link>

      <description>I derived this recipe from combining a couple of recipes:
 https://simpleasthatblog.com/instant-pot-green-chicken-chili/ https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/263617/chef-johns-green-chicken-chili/  We didn&amp;rsquo;t have chipotle powder on hand, so I used paprika as a substitute, and skipped the chile powder that was also mentioned to keep the heat down. I&amp;rsquo;d describe it as not spicy for anyone who normally enjoys spicy foods, and mild for those who are sensitive to it. If you want to make it spicy, using spicier green salsas, keeping the jalape√±o seeds, or using more/different peppers can all do that.</description>

      <description>Great one pot meal using the Instant Pot. We tend to do it with Coconut Milk, since that can store in the pantry.</description>

      <title>Chicken Empanda Filling</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the liberty of modifying the recipe slightly, since we don&amp;rsquo;t usually have achiote or balsalmic vinegar. I replaced the former with some paprika and pepper (the Internet said that was okay) and the latter with some red or cider vinegar with sugar.
If you need to cook shredded chicken relatively quickly:
 Heat a pan to medium-high heat. Drizzle about 1-2 teaspoons of olive oil into the pan. Apply salt and pepper to two chicken breasts, then sear on both sides (about 3-5 minutes per side) Add about 1 cup chicken broth, reduce heat, and cover.</description>

      <description>This recipe is a bit of a mashup of the following sources:
 http://makingthymeforhealth.com/one-pot-vegetable-thai-red-curry/ https://www.lettyskitchen.com/quick-and-easy-potatoes-in-coconut-red-curry-sauce/ https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/thai-chicken-curry-51140410 https://cookieandkate.com/2015/thai-red-curry-recipe/ https://damndelicious.net/2018/02/25/easy-thai-red-curry/  Here&amp;rsquo;s a photo of everything we used in the recipe (banana not necessary, though helpful for pre-meal snacking):</description>

      <description>Hearkens back to the mission. Note that I&amp;rsquo;ve modified this recipe a bit for personal preference. At the end, thicken with a cornstarch slurry as needed. Optionally use creole seasoning or similar instead of salt to add some further spice. Goes great with some sriracha or other hot sauce too.</description>
