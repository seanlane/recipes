      <description>Super simple, super flavorful, super cheap. One of my favorites to make as a poor college student as it&amp;rsquo;s two ingredients and gives me delicious meals for a week plus!

I actually cooked the pork yesterday so this is what I did with some of the leftovers. Usually I just go with the hoagie and provolone combo, but after working in the heat all day today I was craving something with a little more umph and things that are bad for me.</description>
