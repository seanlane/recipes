ingredients:
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 package (19.5 ounce) turkey italian sausage links, removed from casing
- 1 small yellow onion, diced (about 1/2 cup)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth (see note)
- 12-16 ounces whole wheat penne pasta
- 1 can (28 ounce) diced tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1/2 tablespoon dried basil
- 1/4 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
- 6 ounces baby spinach
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, extra for garnishing
- parsley, for garnishing

directions:
- Heat Instant Pot to “Sauté.” 
- Add oil, sausage, and onion. Cook, breaking up sausage into small pieces, until sausage is no longer pink and onions are translucent. 
- Add garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes or until garlic is fragrant.
- Add chicken broth, pasta, diced tomatoes, and oregano. Stir to combine and make sure pasta is submerged in liquid.
- Set Instant Pot to “Manual” for 5 minutes. Turn valve to Seal. 
- When the timer goes off, turn valve to Vent to Quick release the pressure.
- Keep Instant Pot on Warm and add spinach and place cover on (don’t turn to latch). Let wilt for 2-3 minutes, stirring as needed to help it along.
- Add 1 cup mozzarella cheese and stir to melt. If the sauce appears thin, let set for 5-10 minutes, it will thicken.

This recipe is primarily based on https://www.rachelcooks.com/2018/03/12/instant-pot-pasta-sausage-spinach/, but with some further inspiration from https://www.budgetbytes.com/italian-wonderpot/.

You can also use Pork Sausage links, or a regular package of sausage as well. Drain extra grease before adding pasta if needed. You can experiment with using sweet or spicy sausage as well, depending on what you like.
