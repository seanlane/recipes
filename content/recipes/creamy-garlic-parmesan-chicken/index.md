ingredients:
- 6-7 in bone- skin-on chicken thighs
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 tbsp butter
- 7-8 cloves garlic smashed then roughly chopped
- 2-3 cups baby spinach

- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan
- 1/2 tsp to 1 lemon juice to taste

- Pre-heat the oven to 400 F.
- Melt butter and oil together in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add in the the chicken thighs.

- Add in all of the garlic and fry for 1 minute. Add in the spinach and then saute until the spinach shrinks.
- Whisk in the chicken broth, cream and Parmesan. Add in lemon juice to taste.

- Place baby potatoes between the chicken in the 9×13 pan. If you have large chicken thighs, halve the baby potatoes, if you have smaller ones, quarter them so that they cook faster.
- Pour the spinach and cream sauce over top of the chicken and potatoes.
- Bake the chicken in the oven for 25-30 minutes or until the thighs reach a temperature of 175 °F and are tender and cooked all the way through. The potatoes should be tender.
