category: Slow Cooker
yield: 8
prepTime: 15
cookTime: 240

ingredients:
- 1 can (14.5 ounce) diced tomatoes
- 1 can (14.5 ounce) chicken broth
- 1 can (6 ounce) tomato paste
- 3 celery sticks, chopped
- 2 medium green bell peppers, chopped
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 3 teaspoons dried parsley flakes
- 2 teaspoons dried basil
- 1 and a half teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
- 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 pound smoked sausage, halved and cut into 1/4-inch slices

directions:
- Note that veggies can be mixed and added. We usually don't cook with celery, for example
- Throw that mess into the slow cooker and mix it up nicely
- Cook for 4h
- Just before this is done (bout 30 minutes) I'm going to add a pound of Medium Shrimp (peeled and tailless)....Just make sure they're pink before serving
- Steam some rice before throwing the shrimp in the slow cooker
- Once it's done steaming add some hot pepper sauce in the rice
- Serve all that goodness on a nice spicy bed of rice
- Also goes great with corn bread
