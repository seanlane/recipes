yield: 3
prepTime: 10 
cookTime: 

ingredients:
- 1/2 cup Olive oil 
- 1/4 cup Red wine vinegar 
- 1 cup packed Italian(flat leaf) parsley
- 1/2 cup packed Fresh cilantro
- 3 cloves Garlic 
- 1 tsp Dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp Ground cumin 
- 1/4 tsp Red pepper flakes
- 1/2 tsp Salt

directions:
- Rinse the parsley and cilantro well to remove any dirt or debris. Shake as much water off the leaves as possible. Place the parsley, cilantro, and the rest of the ingredients in a food processor. Pulse the ingredients until combined and to your desired texture (coarsely chopped or smooth).
- Use the chimichurri immediately or refrigerate until ready to use.
- If you don't own a food processor, simply whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, oregano, cumin, red pepper, and salt in a bowl. Mince the parsley, cilantro, and garlic. Pour the whisked dressing over the parsley, cilantro, and garlic, then stir to combine.

_Additional Notes_: I used dried oregano to save costs, but if you have fresh available 1-2 Tbsp fresh oregano leaves can be used in place of the dried.
