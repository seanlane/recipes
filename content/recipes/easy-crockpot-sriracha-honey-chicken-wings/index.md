category: Poultry
yield: 6
prepTime: 15
cookTime: 180

ingredients:
- Frozen chicken wing drumettes 4 pounds
- Sriracha sauce (the one with the rooster on the package) 3/4 cup
- Honey 3/4 cup
- Unsalted butter 2 tablespoons
- Juice of one lime (about 1/4 cup)

directions:
- In a 5 quart slow cooker on low add sriracha sauce, butter, honey and lime juice. Stir to combine. Add chicken wings. Stir until wings are well coated. Cook on high for 2-3 hours (or low 4-6 hours) until wings are cooked through.
- Transfer the sauce to a saucepan over medium-high heat and boil it until it reduces to a thicker sauce, approximately 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally.
- Remove wings from slow cooker and place on a baking sheet lined with foil. Drizzle sriracha honey sauce over wings.
- Set oven to broil. Place baking sheet in oven and bake for 2-3 minutes until the sauce starts to caramelize. Remove from oven. Coat wings with sauce again, broil for 1 minute, remove from oven. Coat with sauce, broil 1 minute. Add more sauce, broil until sauce is caramelized.
- Remove from oven, serve and enjoy.

_Additional Notes_:

You can use fresh wings. Cook time would be 3-4 hours on low or 1 to 2 hours on high. Additionally, when using fresh your sauce will cook quicker. Approximately 3-5 minutes.

Instead of cooking the sauce down and broiling it you can mix up 2 tablespoons corn starch and 2 tablespoons water in a resealable container and shake it really well. Pour slurry into crockpot then cook an additional 30 minutes on high.
