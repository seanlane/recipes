Super simple, super flavorful, super cheap. One of my favorites to make as a poor college student as it's two ingredients and gives me delicious meals for a week plus!

If anyone's interested in how I went about constructing this sandwich, here it goes!

I actually cooked the pork yesterday so this is what I did with some of the leftovers. Usually I just go with the hoagie and provolone combo, but after working in the heat all day today I was craving something with a little more umph and things that are bad for me.

Started off heating up some of the pork in a cast iron skillet over low heat while I got the rest of the stuff ready. The aioli consisted of minced garlic, Hellman's Mayonaise, juice from one lemon, and then salt and pepper to taste. Toasted the buns in the oven at 350 with some garlic and butter. Fried up the egg in butter on a separate skillet from the pork and transferred it over on top of my little mountains of pork that I had heating up. Shredded some cheddar over top and covered the skillet to let everything melt together. Popped the buns out of the oven, spread some aioli, and then assembled everything onto the bun and went to town.

Then I took a two hour nap and everything was right in the world.
