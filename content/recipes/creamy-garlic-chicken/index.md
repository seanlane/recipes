yield: 4-6
prepTime: 20
cookTime: 20

ingredients:
  - 2-3 large boneless and skinless chicken breasts halved horizontally to make 4
  - 4 tablespoons flour (all purpose or plain)
  - 1/2 cup and 4 tablespoons finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese, separated
  - 2 teaspoon salt
  - 1 teaspoon garlic powder
  - 1/2 teaspoon Black cracked pepper
  - 5 tablespoons olive oil
  - 2 tablespoons butter
  - 1 small onion finely chopped
  - 1 whole head of garlic peeled and divided into 10-12 cloves
  - 1 1/4 cup chicken broth (stock)
  - 1 1/4 cup half and half or heavy cream (or evaporated milk)
  -  finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese
  - 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, to serve

directions:
- Season the chicken with salt, garlic powder and pepper.
- In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, parmesan cheese.
- Dredge chicken in the flour mixture; shake off excess.
- Heat 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Swirl pan to coat evenly. 
- Fry 2-3 chicken breasts until golden on each side, cooked through and no longer pink (about 4-5 minutes each side, depending on the thickness of your chicken). Transfer to a warm plate. Set aside.
- Wipe pan over with a sheet of paper towel. Repeat with remaining oil, butter and chicken breasts. When cooked, transfer the chicken onto the same plate.
- Reduce heat to medium. Sauté the onion in the remaining oil/juices in the pan until softened. 
- Smash 6 whole cloves of garlic with the blunt edge of the back of a knife 
- Add the remaining oil to the pan and heat through, mixing it through the onions. Sauté smashed garlic cloves and whole garlic cloves until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Add the broth to deglaze the pan. Scrape up any browned bits and let simmer and reduce to half, about 5 minutes.
- Reduce heat to medium-low. Pour in the cream. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer for about 2-3 minutes, combining all of the flavours together.
- Mix in the parmesan cheese. Continue cooking gently for about 2-3 minutes until cheese melts, while stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to your taste. 
- Add the chicken back into the pan and let simmer for a further 2-3 minutes to thicken the sauce to your liking. The chicken breast will soak up all of the delicious flavours.
- Garnish with parsley and a little black cracked pepper. 
- Serve over pasta, cauliflower mash, zucchini noodles, rice or mashed potatoes.
