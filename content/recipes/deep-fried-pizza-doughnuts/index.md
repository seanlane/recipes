components:
- Deep Fried Pizza Dough
- Deep Fried Pizza Filling

directions:
- Flour your work surface thoroughly. ( i use a large cutting board)
- With floured hands, grab a "golf ball sized" amount of dough and flatten it is about 1/8 inch thick. The flattened dough should be about the diameter of a softball. Sprinkle on more flour if needed to keep from sticking.
- Spread 1 TBSP or so of pizza sauce in the center of the dough. Make sure to leave a lip of unsauced dough around the outer edge so you will be able to seal the ball without any mess.
- In a small bowl (or in your hand), smash together 1/4 cup Shredded cheese, 2 TBSP bacon, 2 TBSP pepperoni, then form them into a ball.
- Place cheese ball in the center of the dough and fold one side of the dough on top of the Ball.
- In a circular motion fold up all the sides of the dough until it is completely covering the cheese ball
- Lightly press the folds together to seal the dough together.
- Place in freezer for at least 1 hour
- Cook in oil on medium/high heat until golden brown
- Place on paper plate to remove excess grease before serving
