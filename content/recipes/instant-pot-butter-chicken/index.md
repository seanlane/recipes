  - Instant Pot
  - favorite
yield: 4
prepTime: 10
cookTime: 20
ingredients:
- 1 14 ounce Canned Tomatoes
- 5-6 cloves Garlic
- 1-2 teaspoons minced ginger
- 1 teaspoon Turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoons Cayenne
- 1 teaspoon Smoked Paprika
- 1 teaspoon Salt
- 1 teaspoon Garam Masala
- 1 teaspoon Ground Cumin
- 1 pound Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs (or use breast, bone-in, or whatever works for you. If frozen, add 1-2 minutes to total time)
- 4 ounces butter cut into cubes (use coconut oil if dairy free)
- 4 ounces heavy cream (use full-fat coconut milk if dairy free)
- 1 teaspoon Garam Masala
- 1/4-1/2 cup chopped cilantro

directions:
- "Place all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, **EXCEPT** for the final four: butter, cream, 1 teaspoon of the garam masala, and cilantro. Mix the sauce well before you place the chicken on top of the sauce. If it’s frozen, push it into the sauce a bit so it defrosts better"
- Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high, and let it release pressure naturally for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure. 
- Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside
- Blend together all the ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender
- Add the cut up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated.
- It’s best to let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the cream. Adding it into the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that happens, just put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon
- Take out half the sauce and freeze for later or store in the fridge for 2-3 days
- Add the chicken back in and heat through. Break it up into smaller pieces if you need but don’t shred it.
- Serve over rice, or zucchini noodles

Great one pot meal using the Instant Pot. We tend to do it with Coconut Milk, since that can store in the pantry.
