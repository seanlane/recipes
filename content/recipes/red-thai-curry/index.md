ingredients:
- 1 - 1.5 pounds chicken breast, sliced into small pieces
- 1/2 pound of potatoes, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
- 1-3 Teaspoons of red curry paste
- 1 14 oz can of coconut milk
- 1 1/2  cups of water
- 1-2 red bell pepper, sliced into strips
- 2 Tablespoons of fish sauce
- 2 Teaspoons of rice vinegar (not strictly necessary)
- 1/2 - 1 bunch of cilantro
- About 2-3 Teaspoons of freshly grated ginger
- 3-5 thinly sliced green onions
- 1 small yellow onion, diced
- 3-5 minced cloves of garlic
- 1-2 Tablespoons of olive oil
- Salt and Ground Pepper

directions:
- Season the sliced chicken with salt and pepper, according to personal preference
- In a wok or a large pan with relatively deep edges, heat the olive oil on medium high to high heat
- Add the onions to the pan and saute for 3 to 5 minutes, constantly stirring until they begin to turn golden brown
- Add the garlic and ginger, and saute for another 30-60 seconds, until the garlic and ginger are fragrant
- Optionally add a splash more olive oil if needed to keep the garlic, ginger, and onion from sticking to the pan as you are stirring
- Add the chicken to the pan, stirring until the chicken is cooked
- Scoop in the curry paste, and allow to cook for a minute or two
- Add the water, coconut milk, and potatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer for 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender
- Stir in the cilantro, green onions, red bell peppers, fish sauce, and rice vinegar, and allow to simmer for 5-10 minutes. Taste, and add more fish sauce and curry paste as needed
- Serve over cooked rice
