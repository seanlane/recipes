yield: 6-8
prepTime: 15
cookTime: 25

ingredients:
- 5 bacon slices, diced
- 3 tablespoons of bacon grease (reserved)
- 1 cup of diced onion
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup of all purpose flour
- 2 cups of chicken or vegetable stock
- 2 cups of milk, warmed
- 1.5 pounds of potatos, diced (Yukon gold recommended but not required)
- 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup of plain Greek yogurt or sour cream
- 1 teaspoon of sea salt
- 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper
- optional toppings: thinly-sliced green onions, extra bacon, extra cheese

directions:
- Heat a large stockpot over medium-high heat
- Add diced bacon and cook until crispy, stiring occassionally
- Transfer the bacon to a separate, towel-lined plate, reserving about 3 tablespoons of grease
- Add onions and saute for about 5 minutes, stirring occassionally until soft
- Stir in garlic and saute for an additional 1-2 minutes, until fragrant
- Stir flour into the mixture and saute for another minute or so to cook the flour, stirring occassionally
- Stir in stock until combined, followed by the milk and potatoes
- Continue cooking until the mixture _just_ reaches a simmer, before it begins to boil. Then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 10-15 minutes or until the potatoes are soft.
- Be sure to stir the soup every few minutes to ensure that it doesn't burn.
- Once the potatoes are tender, stir in the cheddar cheese, sour cream, pepper, salt, and cooked bacon bits. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as desired.
- Serve warm, garnished with desired toppings. Leftovers can be transfered to a sealed container and refrigerated for up to 3 days (?).
