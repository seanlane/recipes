ingredients:
- 1 refrigerated pizza crust or equivalent homemade dough
- 2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
- 1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
- 3 1/2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, divided
- 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 2 cups loosely packed spinach leaves
- 8 oz shredded, cooked chicken breast (about 2 cups)
- 2 Roma tomatoes, diced
- Favorite sauces for dipping:
    - Pesto
    - Marinara 
    - Alfredo
    - etc.


directions:
- Preheat over to the temperature indicated for the dough being used.
- Working on a floured surface if needed, roll pizza dough into a 12 x 15 inch rectangle.
- Brush 1 1/2 teaspoons of olive oil across dough surface.
- Evenly sprinkle Italian seasoning and 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese across dough surface.
- Keeping remaining toppings 1 inch away from all edges, even spread spinach leaves, shredded chicken, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese over the dough.
- Working from the long end of the rectangle, roll up from one end to the other (like a cinnamon roll).
- Pinch seam shut, and then pinch each end shut and tuck under toward seam.
- Place seam-side down one a baking sheet sprayed lightly with nonstick spray or lined with parchment paper.
- Brush remaining 1/2 teaspoon olive oil on top and sprinkle with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese.
- Gently cut 3 or 4 slits along the top of the Stromboli (short slits perpendicular to the length of the roll).
- Bake in preheated over for 15-20 minutes or until the top is golden brown.
- Cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing into 1-inch slices.
- Serve with your favorite sauces for dipping.

Be careful to avoid making the dough too thin in the center, otherwise it won't be strong enough to hold the pieces together while dipping. This would probably be pretty awesome with some Pesto mixed into the toppings as well, but that's future scientific research to perform.

If you need to cook shredded chicken relatively quickly:

- Heat a pan to medium-high heat.
- Drizzle about 1-2 teaspoons of olive oil into the pan.
- Apply salt and pepper to two chicken breasts, then sear on both sides (about 3-5 minutes per side)
- Add about 1 cup chicken broth, reduce heat, and cover. Add more chicken broth if necessary, and let cook for 10-15 minutes, until the breasts reach at least 165ËšF. 
- Shred chicken breasts and use for the recipe.
