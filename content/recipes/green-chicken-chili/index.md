  - instant pot
yield: 8
prepTime: 30
cookTime: 30

ingredients:
- 2-3 pounds of boneless chicken breasts (or equivalent amount of thighs)
- 1 medium onion diced
- 2-4 cloves of garlic
- 1 large jalapeño pepper, seeded and sliced
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper
- 2 15 oz. cans of white kidney (aka cannellini) beans, drained and rinsed.
- 15 oz can (or about 2 cups) of chicken broth
- 24-28 oz. of green salsa (salsa verde)*
- 4 oz. can of chopped or diced green chiles (preferably Hatch)
- 1/4 to 1 bunch of cilantro leaves and stems, chopped

- Shredded cheddar cheese for serving
- Sour cream for serving
- Torilla chips for serving

directions:
- Preheat Instant Pot with sauté function.
- If using chicken breasts, add some cooking oil, and brown in the Instant Pot. If using thighs, they'll have enough fat and oil shoudn't be needed.
- Once browned, add everything except for the cilantro, and serving garnishes to the Instant Pot. Set to the Poultry setting, or 15 minutes on high pressure. More time may be needed if your breasts are completely frozen. 15 minutes was enough time for two partially defrosted breasts for us.
- Once the Instant Pot has completed the pressure cycle, either perform a quick release, or allow for a natural release.
- Taste, and add more salt as needed. Stir in the diced cilantro, and allow to keep warm for 5-10 minutes. 
- Serve in bowls over tortilla chips, and topped with a dollop of sour cream and cheddar cheese, as desired.

I derived this recipe from combining a couple of recipes:

* https://simpleasthatblog.com/instant-pot-green-chicken-chili/
* https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/263617/chef-johns-green-chicken-chili/

We didn't have chipotle powder on hand, so I used Paprika as a substitute, and skipped the chile powder that was also mentioned to keep the heat down. I'd describe it as not spicy for anyone who normally enjoys spicy foods, and mild for those who are sensitive to it. If you want to make it spicy, using spicier green salsas, keeping the jalapeño seeds, or using more/different peppers can all do that. 

This recipe can easily be adopted to a slow cooker or stove top pot as well, but using an Instant Pot or pressure cooker will minimize prep time.

\*When buying green salsa, look at the ingredients. The first ingredient should be tomatillos, and the next two should be onion and green chiles (but not necesssarily in that order). Herdez is a pretty good brand, and you can buy canned to keep over time, or fresh salsa if you're able.

Use as much cilantro as you're comfortable with. We love it, so putting in a whole bunch isn't out of the question, as you can see in the image.

Alternative to dicing everything, you can put it all in a blender as well. 

Use less chicken broth if you want a thicker chili, but serving with torilla chips and sour cream will also thicken it up considerably.
