category: Sides
yield: 4-6
prepTime: 15
cookTime: 25

ingredients:
- 2 lbs (6ish medium) russet potatoes, peeled
- 1 1/4 cups hot milk (we used whole milk)
- 2 sticks (226 grams) unsalted butter at room temperature (softened, not melted)
- 1 1/2 tsp salt, or to taste (we used sea salt)
- 1 Tbsp fresh parsley or chives, finely chopped for garnish (optional)

directions:
- Peel potatoes (cut potatoes in half if very large). If you want the smoothest potatoes possible, remove the little knots from the potatoes with a small spoon or the tip of a potatoes peeler. 
- Place potatoes in a large pot (5 Qt+) and cover potatoes with cold water. Bring to a boil and cook partially covered until easily pierced with a knife (boil 20-25 min depending on the size of your potatoes; mine took 22 min).
- Drain well and transfer to the bowl of your stand mixer. Grab the whisk attachment and mash potatoes lightly by hand to break them up. Fit mixer with whisk attachment and start on low speed 30 sec then increase to medium and slowly drizzle in the HOT milk.
- With mixer on, add softened butter 1 Tbsp at a time, waiting a few seconds between each addition. Potatoes will be whipped and fluffy. 
- Finally add 1 1/2 tsp salt, or add to taste.
