yield: 6
prepTime: 15
cookTime: 45

ingredients:
- 1 yellow onion
- 2 lbs. chicken thighs, skin removed
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 Tbsp grated fresh ginger
- Freshly cracked pepper
- 1 1/2 Tbsp garam masala
- 1 1/2 15 oz. cans tomato sauce
- 3/4 cup half and half or heavy cream
- 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 cups cooked rice, to serve 

directions:
- Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate the ginger. 
- Saut√© the onions and garlic in a little olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet until softened, then stir in the ginger, tomato sauce, and spices until fragrant. Transfer to the slow cooker.
- Remove the skins from the chicken (if not already skinless) and nestle the chicken thighs into the slow cooker in the sauce, being sure to smother the chicken in the sauce. Top the chicken with the minced garlic, grated ginger, some freshly cracked pepper, and the garam masala.
- Place the lid on the slow cooker and cook for 4 hours on high.
- When it's finished cooking, carefully remove the chicken thighs from the sauce and transfer them to a cutting board. Use two forks to shred the chicken and remove the bones.
- While the chicken is out of the pot, taste the sauce and add any salt or extra garam masala if desired. Once seasoned to your liking, stir in the half and half or cream.
- Finally, return the shredded chicken meat to the pot and stir to combine. Serve the meat and sauce over rice or with flat bread for scooping up the delicious sauce. Top with freshly chopped cilantro.
