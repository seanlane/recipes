ingredients:
- 1 3 lb. boneless pork roast
- 2 tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 packet ranch dressing mix
- 1 packet dry onion soup mix
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter â€“ REAL salted butter not margarine
- 6-10 pepperoncini peppers
- (Optional) 1 small to medium onion

directions:
- Heat up a large skillet on high. Add oil to hot skillet. 
- Take a paper towel and make sure you dry both sides of the roast. Season with a little bit of freshly ground pepper. 
- Once the skillet is nice and hot, add the roast. You want the skillet to be really hot to brown or "sear" the roast quickly.
- Allow the roast to cook for about 2-3 minutes until it is golden brown. Using tongs, flip the meat over and sear the other side of the roast for another 2-3 minutes. 
- (Optional) Slice the onion into rings or half rings, and lay on the bottom of the slow cooker to form a bed for the roast to lay on as it cooks.
- Transfer meat to slow cooker. 
- Sprinkle packets of dry ranch dressing and onion soup mixes over roast. 
- Top with a stick of butter (or cut the stick up and place pieces on top) then place peppers on and around roast.
- (Optional) Pour some of the pepperoncini juice from the jar on top of the roast.
- Cover and cook on low for 6 hours. 
- After it's cooked, take two forks and start shredding the meat.
- Discard any big fatty pieces. Place pork back into the slow cooker and stir well in the juices to coat.
- Then serve on mashed potatoes, rice or on a roll with a slice of provolone or mozzarella cheese

We've personally found the searing portion of this recipe to not be strictly necessary, and if you like onions then adding a bed of onions to slow cooker with the juices can add some additional flavor. But it's pretty optional as well, and allows for the recipe to be pretty flexible on the prep time.
