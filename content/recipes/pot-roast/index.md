yield: 6
prepTime: 15
cookTime: 360

ingredients:
- 1 chuck roast (mine was 3 pounds)
- Olive oil
- 1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks
- 2 pounds potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
- 1 onion, peeled and cut into large chunks
- 2 stalks celery, cut into large chunks (optional)
- 1 cup beef broth
- 1 tablespoon corn starch
- 2 tablespoons steak seasoning
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon dried thyme
- 1 tablespoon dried rosemary

directions:
- Mix all of the seasonings together in a small bowl, and set aside.
- Coat both sides of meat with olive oil.  Sprinkle on a third of the seasoning mix onto each side.
- Sear both sides of the meat in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Transfer roast to slow cooker. Optionally use a slow cooker liner for easier cleanup.
- Place the vegetables in a large bowl.  Drizzle on a little olive oil to coat vegetables.  Sprinkle on the remaining seasoning mix.  Add the vegetables to the same skillet that was used to sear the meat. Saut√© for about five minutes - stirring occasionally.
- Transfer the vegetables to the top of the roast in the slow cooker.  Pour in the beef broth. Cover with lid.
- Cook on low for 9 hours or on high for 6 hours in the slow cooker.
- Using a turkey baster or ladle, retrieve most of the cooking juices from the slow cooker and transfer to a small sauce pan.
- Bring to a simmer over medium heat on the stovetop.  
- Whisk together the cornstarch with a little water.  Blend into the pan juices while whisking.  Bring back to a simmer until thickened.  
- Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.
- Serve roast and vegetables together, adding gravy on top as desired.
