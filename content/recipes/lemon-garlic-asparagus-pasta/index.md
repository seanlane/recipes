category: pasta
yield: 3
prepTime: 5
cookTime: 20

ingredients:
- 8 oz. pasta 
- 1 bunch asparagus (about 1 lb.) 
- 2 Tbsp butter 
- 2 cloves garlic, minced 
- 1 lemon 
- Salt and Pepper to taste 
- Parmesan cheese (optional)

directions:
- Bring a pot of water to a boil for the pasta. 
- Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until the pasta is tender. 
- Reserve about 1/2 cup of the starchy cooking water, then drain the pasta and set it aside.
- While the pasta is cooking, prepare the asparagus. Remove the bottom 1/2 to 1-inch of the stems, or just the part that is tough and woody. 
- Chop the remaining asparagus into 1-inch pieces.
- Place the asparagus in a large skillet and add about 1/2 inch water. Place a lid on the skillet and bring the water up to a boil. 
- Let the asparagus steam and simmer for about 2 minutes, or just until it turns bright green and has become slightly tender (test with a fork). Drain the asparagus and return it to the skillet.
- Add the butter and minced garlic to the skillet with the asparagus and place it over medium heat. 
- Sauté the partially cooked asparagus in the butter and garlic for about two minutes more, or until the garlic becomes soft and fragrant. *Turn off the heat.*
- Add the cooked and drained pasta to the skillet with the sautéed asparagus. 
- Toss the pasta in the skillet until it is combined with the asparagus and coated with garlic butter. 
- Top with a generous pinch of salt and freshly cracked pepper, and parmesan if desired.
- Use a zester or small-holed cheese grater to zest the lemon onto the pasta. 
- Once zested, slice the lemon in half and squeeze the fresh juice over the pasta. Toss the pasta until everything is well combined, adding a splash of the reserved pasta cooking water if it becomes dry. 
- Taste the pasta and adjust the salt, pepper, or lemon if desired. Serve warm.
