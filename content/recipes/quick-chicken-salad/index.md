ingredients:
- 2 ( 12.5 oz) cans of chicken (or 3 cups diced cooked chicken)
- 3/4 cup light mayonnaise
- 1 cup red grapes, halved
- 1 green onion, diced
- 1 stalk celery, diced
- 1/2 cup diced apple
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder


directions:
- In a bowl, combine the chicken, mayo, grapes, green onion, celery, apple, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Combine until well blended.
- Serve on rolls, bread, or croissants. You can sprinkle with some cashews or pecans if desired, but note that many people with nut allergies usually don't get to eat chicken salad because it often contains nuts, so confirm with guests beforehand.  This can also be served on a lettuce leaf or with saltine crackers.

Note that the only true requirements are probably the chicken, mayo, salt, and pepper, in case you happen to be missing certain things.
