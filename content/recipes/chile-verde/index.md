yield: 6
prepTime: 60
cookTime: 240+

ingredients:
- 2 lbs fatty pork butt cut into large chunks (2″+)
- 1 Tbs olive oil
- 1 Tbs kosher salt
- 2 cloves garlic minced
- 1 tsp cumin
- 2 Anaheim chilies cut in half lengthwise
- 4 Serrano chilies
- 1.5 lbs tomatillos scored so they don’t pop
- 4 large cloves garlic
- 1 large onion cut into 12 wedges
- 2 C chicken broth
- 3 cilantro roots with about 5″ of stem attached
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 tsp honey
- salt and pepper to taste

directions:
- Marinate the pork butt in the oil, garlic, cumin and salt for at least an hour.
- Move the oven rack to the top position. Put the chiles, tomatillos, garlic and onion on a baking sheet and put under a hot broiler. 
- Allow everything to char on top then flip and char the other side. Remove and allow to cool.
- Heat a large heavy bottomed pot over medium heat until very hot then add the pork (no need for oil). Leave the pork undisturbed until it is golden brown. If the pan was hot enough, the pork should not stick to the pan when it is ready to flip, if it sticks, leave it there longer.
- Once the pork is browned on both sides, add the chicken stock, cilantro roots and stems, oregano, cinnamon, and honey. - Destem and seed the roasted peppers (leave the seeds in the Serrano chilies if you want it spicy), core the tomatillos then roughly chop all the roasted veggies and add them to the pot along with any juices on the baking sheet.
- Turn down heat to medium low and partially cover the pot with a lid (leaving room for steam to escape). Simmer for 3-4 hours or until the meat falls apart when a fork is inserted. During the last 30 minutes of cooking, simmer with the lid off allowing the chile to thicken (should be about the consistency of salsa). Salt and pepper to taste and serve with warm (preferably home-made) tortillas.
