ingredients:
- 1 cup long grain white rice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 8 oz can of tomato sauce
- 1 red bell pepper cored, seeded and quartered
- 1 1/2 cups chicken stock or vegetable broth
- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt

directions:
- Heat the olive oil in a 2 quart pot over medium heat. 
- Add the rice and stir until the rice is coated in the oil. 
- Cook for about 5 minutes or until the rice is toasted and lightly browned.
- Add all of the remaining ingredients. I recommend doing this off the heat to avoid splattering.
- Return the pot to the burner, bring the contents to a boil.
- Cover the pot and turn the heat to low
- Cook for 17 minutes.
- Take the pot off the heat and let it stand, covered for 5 minutes.
